Used a more sophisticated arrangement with a pentagon in the center\n   - Placed circles in strategic positions rather than simple concentric rings\n   - Utilized corner and edge spaces more effectively\n\n2. **More efficient radius computation**:\n   - Implemented an iterative approach that adjusts radii until convergence\n   - Prioritizes reducing larger radii when conflicts occur, which tends to maximize the sum\n\n3. **Strategic positioning**:\n   - Manually positioned some circles to take advantage of geometric insights\n   - Used different numbers of circles in different rings to better match the square boundary\n   - Added specific adjustments to maximize space utilization\n\nThis implementation should produce a significantly better circle packing than the original, approaching the target of 2.635 for the sum of radii."]}}}
