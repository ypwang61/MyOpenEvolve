Implemented a more efficient hexagonal packing pattern for the core circles\n   - Placed circles in strategic positions that better utilize the square space\n   - Created a balanced distribution with specialized placement for edge and corner circles\n\n2. **Improved Radius Computation**:\n   - Enhanced the `compute_max_radii` function with better convergence properties\n   - Added proportional scaling when resolving overlaps\n   - Implemented a bias to favor larger circles in certain positions\n   - Added a final optimization pass to maximize each circle individually\n\n3. **Efficient Implementation**:\n   - Reduced the number of unnecessary iterations\n   - Used more precise geometric calculations\n   - Implemented early stopping when no changes are detected\n   - Added an optional position optimization function for fine-tuning\n\nThese changes should significantly increase the sum of radii while maintaining validity, bringing the performance closer to the target of 2.635 achieved in the AlphaEvolve paper."]}}}
