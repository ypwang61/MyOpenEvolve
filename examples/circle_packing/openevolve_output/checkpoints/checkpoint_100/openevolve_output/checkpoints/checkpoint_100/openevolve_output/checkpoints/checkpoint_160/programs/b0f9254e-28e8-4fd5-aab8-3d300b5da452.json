This helps to better separate the circles and prevent them from getting stuck in local minima.\n\n*   **Reduced Timestep:** `dt` reduced to 0.007. Smaller timesteps generally lead to more stable and accurate physics simulations, especially with increased repulsion.\n\n*   **Increased Dampening:** `dampening` increased to 0.88. Higher dampening helps to dissipate energy from the system more quickly, preventing oscillations and leading to faster convergence.\n\n*   **Increased Growth Factor:** `growth_factor` increased to 0.17. This allows the circles to adjust their radii more aggressively based on available space, potentially leading to better packing density.\n\n*   **Increased Iterations:** `iterations` increased to 2500. More iterations give the optimization algorithm more time to converge to a good solution.\n\nThese changes aim to improve the stability, convergence speed, and exploration of the solution space, leading to a higher sum of radii. The adjustments were made based on the understanding that the previous settings might have been too conservative, preventing the system from fully exploring the potential for better packing.\n"]}}}
