Physics-based simulation with both repulsive and attractive forces\n   - Radius maximization that carefully handles constraints\n   - Fine-tuning with small adjustments to improve the total sum\n\n3. **Dynamic Parameters**: The algorithm adjusts parameters during optimization, reducing repulsion and increasing attraction over time.\n\n4. **Validation**: Added a function to verify the packing validity at any point.\n\n5. **Efficiency Improvements**: The code is structured to avoid unnecessary calculations and uses vectorized operations where possible.\n\nThe key insight is that for n=26, a hybrid pattern with variable-sized circles is needed to approach the target of 2.635. The central circle should be larger, with progressively smaller circles toward the edges. The physics-based optimization allows circles to find their natural positions while the fine-tuning stage helps maximize the sum of radii."]}}}
