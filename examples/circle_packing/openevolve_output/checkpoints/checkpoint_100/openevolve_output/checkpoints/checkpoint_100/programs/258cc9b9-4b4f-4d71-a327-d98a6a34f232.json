patterns known to be effective for circle packing problems.\n\n2. **Efficient Physics Simulation**: Implements a faster physics-based optimization with:\n   - Reduced iteration count to avoid timeout\n   - Optimized force calculations (computing each pair only once)\n   - Simplified border forces\n\n3. **Improved Radius Calculation**: Uses a multi-pass approach to calculate radii:\n   - First limiting by borders\n   - Then adjusting for circle-circle interactions\n   - Final pass to ensure no overlaps\n\n4. **Eliminated Unnecessary Complexity**: Removed the complex multi-stage optimization and local search that was causing timeouts.\n\nThe code is now more focused on a specialized pattern for n=26 rather than a generic approach, which should yield better results for this specific problem while running much faster to avoid timeouts."]}}}
