This version incorporates a more aggressive optimization strategy, adaptive radius adjustments, and refined penalty functions to break through the 2.636 plateau. Simulated annealing is used for initial rough positioning, and a gradient-based method for fine-tuning.  The initialization patterns are also more carefully tuned to reflect known good configurations.\"\"\"\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize, basinhopping\nimport time\nimport logging\n\n# Configure logging (optional, but helpful for debugging)\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s -
