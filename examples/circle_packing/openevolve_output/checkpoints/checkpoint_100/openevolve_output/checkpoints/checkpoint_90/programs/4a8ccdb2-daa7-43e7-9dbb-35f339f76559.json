Phase 1: Strategic initialization with a pattern based on mathematical insights\n   - Phase 2: Billiard-based optimization that simulates physical collisions\n   - Phase 3: Gradient-based fine-tuning to maximize radii\n\n2. **Strategic pattern initialization**:\n   - Uses a hybrid pattern with concentric rings and corner/edge placement\n   - Assigns different initial radii based on position (larger in center, smaller at edges)\n\n3. **Billiard optimization algorithm**:\n   - Simulates physical collisions between circles and walls\n   - Allows circles to move and adjust their sizes dynamically\n   - Uses velocity and damping to help circles find better positions\n\n4. **Gradient fine-tuning**:\n   - Uses gradients to optimize both positions and radii\n   - Balances the competing objectives of maximizing radii and preventing overlaps\n   - Includes a final pass to ensure maximum possible radii\n\n5. **Parameter tuning**:\n   - Carefully balanced parameters for expansion rate, learning rate, and iterations\n   - Adjusted damping and collision response to prevent oscillations\n\nThis approach should significantly improve the sum of radii toward the target of 2.635, while maintaining validity and reasonable execution time."]}}}
