Uses repulsive forces to prevent overlaps\n   - Uses attractive forces to maintain structure\n   - Applies border forces to keep circles within bounds\n\n3. **Reduced iterations**: Significantly reduced the number of iterations in both optimization phases\n\n4. **Simplified radius calculation**: Streamlined the radius computation with a more direct approach that handles overlaps efficiently\n\n5. **Eliminated gradient calculations**: Removed the computationally expensive gradient calculations that likely contributed to the timeout\n\n6. **More deterministic approach**: The new algorithm relies less on random exploration and more on mathematical principles of circle packing\n\nThis implementation should be much faster while still producing a good packing arrangement that approaches the target sum of radii."]}}}
