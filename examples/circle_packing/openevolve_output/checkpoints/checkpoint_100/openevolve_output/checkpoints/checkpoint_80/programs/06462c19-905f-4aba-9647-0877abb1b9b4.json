Removed dependency on scipy to fix the execution error\n2. Implemented a multi-stage optimization process with different parameters for each stage\n3. Created a specialized initialization pattern based on known good configurations for 26 circles\n4. Added variable circle behavior where larger circles exert more force\n5. Implemented progressive border forces that strengthen near edges\n6. Used adaptive learning rates that decrease over iterations\n7. Added soft clamping to prevent circles from getting stuck at boundaries\n8. Optimized the max radii computation algorithm\n9. Implemented size-based scaling factors for more nuanced physics simulation\n10. Added strategic positioning with non-uniform grid for the initial pattern\n11. Used small perturbations to break symmetry and improve packing\n\nThis implementation should significantly improve the sum of radii while maintaining validity by using a physics-based approach with carefully tuned parameters that works toward the target of 2.635."]}}}
