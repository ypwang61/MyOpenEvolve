Initial pattern placement with variable-sized circles\n   - Uniform growth phase to quickly establish a baseline\n   - Force-directed position optimization to resolve overlaps\n   - Individual radius optimization to maximize the total sum\n   - Final refinement phase for fine-tuning\n\n3. **Specialized pattern for n=26**:\n   - Uses a 5\u00d75 grid plus one strategic circle\n   - Implements variable sizing with larger circles in the center\n\n4. **Robust constraint checking**:\n   - Comprehensive overlap detection between circles\n   - Boundary constraint enforcement\n\n5. **Adaptive step sizes**:\n   - Decreasing step sizes during optimization for better convergence\n   - Different step sizes for different optimization phases\n\nThis implementation should significantly improve the sum of radii while maintaining validity, all without requiring external dependencies."]}}}
