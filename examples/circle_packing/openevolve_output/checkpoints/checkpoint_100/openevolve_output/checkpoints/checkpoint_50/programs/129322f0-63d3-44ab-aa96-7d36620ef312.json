First optimize positions with fixed radii\n   - Then grow radii while maintaining validity\n   - Finally fine-tune with individual radius adjustments\n\n2. **Specialized initialization pattern**:\n   - Carefully designed concentric rings with strategic sizing\n   - More deliberate placement of circles at corners and edges\n\n3. **Improved physics model**:\n   - More sophisticated collision detection and resolution\n   - Gradual growth strategy with controlled adjustments\n   - Proportional shrinking when overlaps occur\n\n4. **Space utilization optimization**:\n   - Individual radius growth based on available space\n   - Prioritizing overall sum maximization\n   - Balancing between position adjustments and radius changes\n\n5. **Robust overlap prevention**:\n   - Dedicated function to ensure no overlaps exist\n   - Multiple resolution passes per growth step\n   - Graceful degradation when constraints can't be satisfied\n\nThis approach should significantly improve the sum of radii while maintaining validity, bringing us closer to the target of 2.635."]}}}
