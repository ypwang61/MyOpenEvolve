A pure hexagonal arrangement may not be optimal due to edge effects\n3. The densest known circle packings often use a hybrid approach\n4. The optimization routine is critically important - simple physics-based models with carefully tuned parameters\n5. Consider strategic placement of circles at square corners and edges\n6.
