A central circle\n   - An inner ring of 6 circles in a hexagonal pattern\n   - A middle ring of 12 circles\n   - 4 circles in the corners\n   - 4 circles along the edges\n\n2. **Fine-tuned Positioning**: The positions have been carefully adjusted to maximize the packing density, with slight variations in distance from the center based on position.\n\n3. **Improved Radius Calculation**: The `compute_max_radii` function now uses an iterative approach that converges to a more accurate solution than the proportional scaling in the original code.\n\n4. **Optimized Parameters**: The distances and positions have been fine-tuned based on geometric principles of circle packing, particularly considering the hexagonal pattern which is known to be efficient for circle packing.\n\nThis implementation should achieve a significantly higher sum of radii, approaching the 2.635 value mentioned in the AlphaEvolve paper."]}}}
