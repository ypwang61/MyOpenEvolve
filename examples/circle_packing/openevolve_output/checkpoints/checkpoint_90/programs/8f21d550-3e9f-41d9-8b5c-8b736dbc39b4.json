This uses a gradually decreasing learning rate and only accepts changes that improve the total.\n\n4. **Validation Function**: Added an explicit validation function to ensure the packing remains valid throughout the optimization process.\n\n5. **Parameter Tuning**: Carefully tuned the distances between rings and the optimization parameters to achieve a better balance between exploration and stability.\n\nThe new implementation should produce a valid packing with a significantly higher sum of radii, approaching the 2.635 target mentioned in the AlphaEvolve paper."]}}}
